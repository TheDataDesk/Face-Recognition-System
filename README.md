# Face Recognition & License Verification using LBPH

This project implements a real-time **face recognition system** using the **Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH)** algorithm with OpenCV. It captures faces via webcam, trains an identity model, and verifies a person against a known license record.

> üî¨ This is a classic machine learning-based face recognition system ‚Äî built entirely in Python with no deep learning dependencies.

---

## Algorithms & Approach

- **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)**  
  Converts grayscale face images into spatial histograms of local binary patterns, then matches via Euclidean distance.

- **Haar Cascade Classifier**  
  Detects faces in video frames for image capture and real-time recognition.

- **License Database (JSON)**  
  Simple mapping between recognized person IDs and license data (name, expiry date, ID number).

- **OpenCV (cv2)**  
  Handles webcam streaming, face detection, model training, and recognition.

## Usage Instructions

### Collect Face Images

```bash
python src/collect_faces.py
```

You'll be prompted:

```text
Enter person name (folder name under 'dataset/'): person_001
```

Then:
- Press `'c'` to capture a face sample
- Press `'q'` to stop

Images will be saved to `dataset/person_001/`. Repeat for other users.

---

### Train the LBPH Model

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

- Reads all folders in `dataset/`
- Trains the LBPH model
- Saves the model to `trainer/lbph_model.yml`
- Saves the label map to `labels.json`

---

### Run Live Face Recognition

```bash
python src/recognize_live.py
```

- Opens the webcam
- Detects faces and matches against trained identities
- On match, displays the license info in a pop-up or overlay

---

## Sample `licenses.json`

```json
{
  "person_001": {
    "Name": "Sirisha",
    "License ID": "ABC1234567",
    "Valid Until": "2027-06-15",
    "Status": " Valid"
  },
  "person_002": {
    "Name": "Alex",
    "License ID": "XYZ9876543",
    "Valid Until": "2026-12-31",
    "Status": "Valid"
  }
}
```

---

## LBPH in a Nutshell

- Grayscale image is divided into cells
- Each cell is converted to a Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
- Histograms of LBP codes are calculated
- Distance between histograms = confidence score
- Lower score = better match

## ‚öôÔ∏è File Outputs (After Running)

| File                | When It's Generated       | Purpose                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| `dataset/`          | after `collect_faces.py`  | Stores captured face images  |
| `trainer/lbph_model.yml` | after `train_model.py`     | Trained LBPH model           |
| `labels.json`       | after `train_model.py`     | Label-to-name mapping        |
| `licenses.json`     | manually provided          | Person ‚Üí License info map    |

## .gitignore Includes

```gitignore
dataset/
trainer/
*.yml
__pycache__/
*.log
```

---

## Accuracy Tips

- Capture 100+ varied images per person
- Vary lighting, angle, expression
- Keep consistent image size (200√ó200)
- Use histogram equalization if lighting differs

---

## Future Work

- Upgrade to DeepFace or InsightFace (deep learning)
- Add liveness detection to prevent spoofing
- Save access logs with timestamps
- Add expiration validation to licenses
- Deploy with FastAPI + Streamlit for web dashboard
